q		# 🏠 House Price Prediction (Nigeria)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning system that predicts house prices across different states in Nigeria. The goal is to use historical housing data to estimate property prices based on selected housing features.

The model is designed to help buyers, sellers, and real estate stakeholders understand housing price trends and make data-driven decisions.



## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains housing information across Nigeria. It includes property details and pricing information used to train and evaluate the prediction model.

Dataset File:
	•	nigeria_houses_data.csv

The dataset contains housing attributes such as:
	•	Location
	•	Property features
	•	Housing characteristics
	•	Price information



## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on input housing features.

Workflow

	1.	Data Collection
	2.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
	3.	Feature Selection
	4.	Model Training
	5.	Model Evaluation
	6.	Prediction Interface Development



## 🛠️Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Machine Learning Libraries (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
	•	Web Technologies
	•	HTML
	•	CSS
	•	JavaScript

## 📈 Model Performance

The  model was evaluated using standard regression performance metrics such as:

	•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
	•	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
	•	Prediction Accuracy Evaluation

## 💻 Usage

Users can input housing details through the application interface. The system then processes the input and returns an estimated house price.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
	•	Expand dataset coverage across more Nigerian states
	•	Improve feature engineering for better prediction accuracy
	•	Deploy the application to a cloud platform
	•	Add real-time housing market data integration
	•	Improve user interface and visualization features
